# **Schizophrenia Case Study: Data Analysis with Python**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes schizophrenia-related data using Python to uncover patterns and trends through **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. It aims to identify key factors associated with the disorder by applying statistical methods and visualizations.  

## **Data and Methodology**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and ensured consistency.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed distributions, correlations, and key trends using statistical techniques.  
- **Visualizations:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate patterns in the dataset.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied descriptive statistics to extract meaningful insights.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Statistical Analysis (Histogram, Barcharts, Descriptive Statistics, Correlation)  

## **Key Insights**  
The case study provides a structured approach to understanding schizophrenia through data-driven analysis, offering insights into potential risk factors and patterns.  

## **Usage**  
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis. The dataset and code can be modified for further investigation.
